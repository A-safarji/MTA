# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects of MTA Turnstile Data:

## Abstract 

The goal of this project would be an identification of the subway stations that have the most traffics and crowds, correlated with those who commute every day. And to help decreasing crowds from busy stations. For these, I will also include stations and external sources that can support reducing crowds in busy stations between morning and evening time. 

## Design 

The project utilizes a dataset provided by the MTA that helps in getting information regarding the stations especially the turnstiles information. MTA APIs for maps and line logos. Therefore, the design detect congestins based on stations exits, entries between moring and evening. After detecting, the model will generate live map for spoting congestins, to enable MTA take action to improve operations and support busy stations.  

## Data 

The dataset contains over 2.5 million observations in the period from July to September of 2021 with 11 columns. A few feature highlights include numbers of entries/exits for each station. In addtion, using MTA maps dataset for individual features for each station by using  latitude/longitude coordinates and it contians 496 rows Ã— 14 columns.   

## Algorithms 

Exploratory data analysis techniques are used to clean the data and form a proper dataset that can be reasonably aggregated and visualized. 

## Tools 
* To carry out the project and explore the data, Jupyter,Sqllite3 and Python3. In addition, Python3 libraries which are: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly-express for data visualization. Numpy, and Panda for data read and write operations.
* Using Folium and plotly dash for maps visualization.  


## Communication 

In addition to the slides and visuals presented,[EDA of MTA Turnstile](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/dashboard/A-safarji:10/view) will be embedded on my personal dashbored.
