# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects of MTA Turnstile Data:

## Abstract 

The goal of this project would be an identification of the subway stations that have the most traffics and crowds, correlated with those who commute every day. And to help decreasing crowds from busy stations. For these, I will also include stations and external sources that can support reducing crowds in busy stations between morning and evening time. 

## Design 

The project utilizes a dataset provided by the MTA that helps in getting information regarding the stations especially the turnstiles information. MTA APIs for maps and line logos. Therefore, the design detect congestins based on stations exits, entries between moring and evening. After detecting, the model will generate live map for spoting congestins, to enable MTA take action to improve operations and support busy stations.  

## Data 

The dataset contains over 2.5 million observations in the period from July to September of 2021, and  after grouping the data we reached 379 observations of the stations in the dataset.     

## Algorithms 

Exploratory data analysis techniques are used to clean the data and form a proper dataset that can be reasonably aggregated and visualized. 

## Tools 

* Pandas for data manipulation.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting. 

## Communication 

In addition to the visuals presented this plot is presented to further elaborate on the point of the project.
